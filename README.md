# educational_sims_repo
Some physics simulations in Blender for educational purposes

This repository contains simple physics simulations using Blender and its force fields features. The aim is to provide a visual representation and understanding of fundamental physics phenomena through interactive simulations.

Simulations Included
Rolling of Rigid Bodies
Electric Dipoles
Particles in Magnetic Fields
Conservation of Momentum
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Blender (Version XX.XX or later)
Installation
Clone the repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/chainReactionCol/eduational_sims_repo.git

Usage
Open Blender and load the simulation file you are interested in.
Press the "Play" button to start the simulation.
You can adjust the parameters within the Blender interface to observe different behaviors.
Contributing
Feel free to fork the project, create a feature branch, and send us a pull request.
